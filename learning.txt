Django Crispy Forms

    I had thought you could specify a class on a widget directly in your form
    and css_classes defined in the library were just appended.  This does not appear to be
    the case.

Django Templates

    You cannot have a block inside a html template which is included by the include tag
    in the django template.  I realised this with grid_lines.html.

Python MRO

    I thought the base class in Python was left most in the classes to inherit from but i read
    a comment on Stackoverflow which said it was righmost.  Will clarify this when i finish the
    book "Effective Python"


Django Formsets

    Forms in a formset will have empty_permitted = True for new creations i.e. forms not corresponding to DB instances
    For forms with a DB instance, the INITIAL_FORMS count must be correct, so that empty_permitted = False
    This caught me out in testing.

    The empty form is created a in different way to the actual forms.  And so you cannot just pass extra kwargs
    via _construct_form and expect them to come through to empty form.  Absolute swine this was.


Django Model Stackoverflow

    I wrongly assumed that Django does not update the DB again if twice is called a second time despite no
    further changes.

Django Responses

    Remember that a HttpRedirect with a status code of 302 is the standard response for a successful POST.
    This will have a content of 0 bytes.  This response tells the browser to issue a request to the said
    url.  The server then responds to this further request.
