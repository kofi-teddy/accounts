PRIORITY 1

    The red triangle on the table elements which contain field errors requires position:relative; this means
    the dropdown for the input widget does not work.  I tried to detect focus in and out of the td element but
    the body element gets focus even when i click on elements inside the td element.  So i have no choice put
    to clone the dropdown menu and position it relative to the whole grid container.  This shouldn't require
    any change to the widget luckily.  And the change shouldn't be in the widget module because this isn't
    a problem with the widget.  Rather the design around the widget.

    No left padding on some input fields in the input grid following the containment of the input with a div element

    Rename "Match" header section to "Outstanding"

PRIORITY 2

    Matching tables did not align because of scrollbar.  To consider ...

    Use pgAdmin instead of adminer for a DB GUI

    Refactor the styles in styles.css and ui_elem_styles.css.  Styles in the first sheet probably belong to the second.
    The second sheet could do with being renamed
