Worth reading over this before making changes to the software -

    We want to always save Decimal(0.00) to the DB rather than null.  We do this by
    inheriting from a DecimalBaseModel which has a clean method to ensure this
    value is saved to the DB.  But remember this is only called within the
    context of form processing.
