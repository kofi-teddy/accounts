   Edit -

        We also need to add a test which checks that new lines marked as deleted do not show.  I think
        the better thing to do actually would be to delete new lines on the client and only set the
        DELETE flag on those which have primary keys.

        The redirection to transaction enquiry at the moment does not show the "Transaction successfully posted" message.
        Only when the user goes back to the create view does it show...

        The fields for the match form should have the disabled attribute set really.  Except for those we are setting.
        Need to look into this.  At the moment i just set readonly as an attribute on the widget which i don't think
        is the same.

    Templates -

        FIX ME - change 'matching_formset" to "match_formset" in the template


        jQueryDataTables class should be renamed to contain "Mixin" because this is what is is.
